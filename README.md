This repository contains supplementary figures for the bachelor's project titled 'Production of free radicals in aqueous solutions by means of plasma treatment'.

## Abstract of the project: 
When aqueous solutions are exposed to cold atmospheric plasma, radicals are generated within. Two methods are investigated; in-liquid and above-liquid plasma exposure. By adding a spintrap to the sample, we attain adducts detectable through EPR over feasible timespans. Knowing the intensity with which normalized, simulated base spectra occur in measured spectra, we can obtain hydroxyl and hydrogen adduct concentrations and determine generation rates corresponding to different methods and/or gasses. We compare in-liquid and above-liquid hydroxyl adduct generation rates using He plasma. It is found that this rate for in-liquid treatment is roughly twice the rate for above-liquid treatment. The computed generation rate for Ar above-liquid treatment is approximately five times that of He above-liquid treatment.  

## Content of the repository:
This repository contains the plotted timeseries of the estimated DMPO-OH concentrations for above-liquid He and Ar plasma treated solutions. The files are named UG[yyyymmdd][gas]\_out\_[treatment time].
